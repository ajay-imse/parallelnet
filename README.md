Based on arXiv:1903.06379, Enabling spike based backprop in deep NN architectures.
\

Learning is by back propagation through time, spike data is framed in time steps. For regular MNIST, it is poisson encoded.
Network in  code is for net input - 2x(5c5-2p-5c5-2p-25fc)-10output
with varying decay for each net
